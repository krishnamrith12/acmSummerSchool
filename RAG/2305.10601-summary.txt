# Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models

## Abstract
Language models (LMs) are powerful tools for problem-solving tasks, but they are limited by their token-level, left-to-right decision-making process. This paper introduces a new framework called "Tree of Thoughts" (ToT) that allows LMs to perform deliberate decision-making by considering multiple reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices. ToT enables exploration over coherent units of text ("thoughts") that serve as intermediate steps toward problem-solving. The experiments show that ToT significantly enhances LM's problem-solving abilities on tasks requiring planning or search.

## Introduction
This section discusses the limitations of current language models in problem-solving tasks and introduces the concept of "System 1" and "System 2" decision-making processes. It also highlights the need for a more deliberate planning process in language models.

## Background
This section provides an overview of existing methods that use large language models for problem-solving, such as input-output prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.

## Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with LM
This section introduces the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework for problem-solving with language models. It explains the thought decomposition, thought generation, state evaluation, and search algorithms used in ToT.

## Experiments
This section presents the experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of ToT on three novel tasks: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords. It compares the results of ToT with other baselines and analyzes the impact of different factors on performance.

## Related Work
This section discusses related work in the areas of planning and decision-making, self-reflection, program-guided LM generation, and classical search methods.

## Discussion
This section discusses the limitations of ToT and suggests future directions for research.

## Conclusion
The paper concludes by summarizing the key contributions of ToT and its potential impact on problem-solving with language models.

## Broader Impact
This section discusses the potential impact of ToT on various applications and highlights the importance of responsible use of language models.
